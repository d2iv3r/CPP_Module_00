# C++ Module: Basics of C++ Programming

## Overview

This module serves as an introduction to the foundational elements of C++ programming. It covers key concepts such as namespaces, classes, member functions, `stdio` streams, initialization lists, `static`, and `const` variables. These concepts are essential for writing clean, efficient, and well-structured C++ programs.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Namespaces**
- Understanding the role of namespaces in organizing code.
- How to use `std` and create your own namespaces.
- Preventing name conflicts using namespaces.

### 2. **Classes and Member Functions**
- Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
- Creating classes, defining member variables and functions.
- Understanding access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).
  
### 3. **Standard Input/Output Streams (stdio)**
- Using `std::cin`, `std::cout`, `std::cerr`, and `std::clog`.
- Difference between `std::cout` and `std::cerr`.
- How to format output and handle errors.

### 4. **Initialization Lists**
- Using initialization lists to initialize member variables in constructors.
- Benefits of using initialization lists over assignment in constructors.

### 5. **Static Variables and Functions**
- Understanding the `static` keyword in variables and functions.
- Scope and lifetime of static variables.
- Static member functions and accessing class data.

### 6. **Constant Variables**
- Declaring and using `const` variables.
- Difference between `const` and `#define` preprocessor macros.
- Best practices for using `const` in your programs.

### 7. **Basic Syntax and Concepts**
- Writing basic functions and understanding C++ syntax.
- Simple programs to demonstrate the aforementioned topics.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Eclipse)

## How to Run

1. Install a C++ compiler and text editor/IDE of your choice.
2. Clone this repository or download the module files.
3. Open the project folder in your IDE or text editor.
4. Compile the program using the C++ compiler.

For example, if using GCC, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
cd ex00
make
./ex00
