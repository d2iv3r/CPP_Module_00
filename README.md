# C++ Module 00

## Overview

This is the first module of a C++ series, introducing the basics of C++ programming. The module covers fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions. It is designed for beginners to gain a solid understanding of the core principles required for more advanced topics in C++.

## Goals

- Understand the structure of a C++ program.
- Learn how to declare and use variables.
- Master the basic data types in C++ (int, float, char, etc.).
- Implement control structures such as loops and conditionals.
- Write simple functions and understand how to use them.
- Explore basic input/output (I/O) in C++.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to C++ syntax
- Variables and data types
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions (declaration, definition, calling)
- Basic Input/Output (cin, cout)

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Eclipse)

## How to Run

1. Install a C++ compiler and text editor/IDE of your choice.
2. Clone this repository or download the module files.
3. Open the project folder in your IDE or text editor.
4. Compile the program using the C++ compiler.

For example, if using GCC, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
cd ex00
make
./ex00
